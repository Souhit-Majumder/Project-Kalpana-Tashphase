# Tinkercad Electronics Projects

This repository documents three Arduino-based electronics simulations created in [Tinkercad Circuits](https://www.tinkercad.com/). Each project explores core concepts in digital logic and interactive electronics.

## 1. LED Brightness Control with Button (3 Levels)

### Description:
This project allows a single pushbutton to control the brightness of an LED. Each press cycles through three brightness levels: **low**, **medium**, and **high**. After the third level, the cycle restarts.

### Key Concepts:
- Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)
- State-based button input
- Sequential control logic

## 2. 4-Bit Up Counter Using LEDs

### Description:
This project simulates a 4-bit binary up counter. LEDs visually represent the binary output, incrementing from **0 (0000)** to **15 (1111)** in regular intervals.

### Key Concepts:
- Binary counting
- Bitwise operations
- Visualizing digital logic

## 3. 7-Segment Display Counter (1 to 1000 and Back)

### Description:
This project uses a 7-segment display to count from **1 to 1000** and then back down to **1**, with a pause at 1000 and looping continuously. The display updates at set time intervals.

### Key Concepts:
- Number display on 7-segment outputs
- Loop control and directional counting
- Efficient number-to-segment mapping

## Notes

- All simulations were built and tested in Tinkercad Circuits.
- Ideal for practicing logic control, counting, and display management using Arduino.
